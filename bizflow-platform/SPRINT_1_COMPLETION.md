3. **Set up PostgreSQL database and update .env file**

4. **Run database migrations:**
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:generate
   ```

5. **Start both services:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - API
   cd api && npm run dev

   # Terminal 2 - Web App
   cd web-app && npm run dev
   ```
