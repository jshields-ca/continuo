## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
Users (id, email, password_hash, name, image, created_at, updated_at)
Companies (id, user_id, name, industry, settings, created_at, updated_at)
Accounts (OAuth provider accounts)
Sessions (NextAuth.js sessions)
VerificationTokens (email verification)
```

### Key Components Built
- `AuthForm` - Reusable authentication form with validation
- `Button`, `Input`, `Label`, `Card` - UI component library
- Landing page with hero section and feature highlights
