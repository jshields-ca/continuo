# Linear Best Practices for Continuo Development

## 📋 **Linear Setup Overview**

### Project Structure
- **Team**: Business Dev (f42ec684-5540-47fd-8ff2-6a488004cac3)
- **Project**: Continuo (e9205c7b-a881-498d-acdf-8361f3bfcdd4)
- **Issue Statuses**: Backlog, Todo, In Progress, localhost Testing, Prod Testing, In Review, Done, Canceled, Duplicate

### Issue Status Workflow
```
Backlog → Todo → In Progress → localhost Testing → Prod Testing → In Review → Done
```
- **Backlog**: Not yet planned for work, future consideration.
- **Todo**: Planned and ready to be worked on in the current or next sprint.
- **In Progress**: Actively being worked on by an assignee.
- **localhost Testing**: Feature/bugfix is ready for or undergoing local environment testing.
- **Prod Testing**: Feature/bugfix is deployed to production or staging for final verification.
- **In Review**: Awaiting code review, QA, or stakeholder approval.
- **Done**: Completed, merged, and deployed as appropriate.
- **Canceled**: Work was stopped and will not be completed.
- **Duplicate**: Issue is a duplicate of another and will not be worked on.

> **Note:** If any labels listed in this document are not present in Linear, they should be created to ensure consistent issue tracking and filtering.

### Priority Levels
- **Urgent (1)**: Critical bugs, security issues, blocking issues
- **High (2)**: Sprint features, major functionality
- **Medium (3)**: Enhancements, improvements
- **Low (4)**: Nice-to-have features, documentation
- **No Priority (0)**: Backlog items, future considerations

## 🏷️ Issue Labeling Strategy

### Feature Labels
- `feature/crm` - Customer Relationship Management
- `feature/accounting` - Accounting and Finance
- `feature/projects` - Project Management
- `feature/reporting` - Reporting and Analytics
- `feature/ui-ux` - User Interface and Experience

### Type Labels
- `type/feature` - New functionality
- `type/bug` - Bug fixes
- `type/enhancement` - Improvements to existing features
- `type/documentation` - Documentation updates
- `type/refactor` - Code refactoring
- `type/testing` - Testing and quality assurance

### Priority Labels
- `priority/critical` - Must be addressed immediately
- `priority/high` - Important for current sprint
- `priority/medium` - Important but not urgent
- `priority/low` - Nice to have

### Component Labels
- `component/backend` - Backend/API work
- `component/frontend` - Frontend/UI work
- `component/database` - Database schema and migrations
- `component/security` - Security-related work
- `component/devops` - Infrastructure and deployment

## 📝 Issue Creation Guidelines

### Issue Title Convention
```
[Module] Brief description of the feature/task
```

Examples:
- `[CRM Module] Customer Database Implementation`
- `[Accounting Module] Invoice Generation System`
- `[Project Management] Time Tracking System`
- `[UX] Responsive Design Implementation`

> **All new issues must use this bracketed format. Automated checks will flag issues that do not comply.**

### Issue Description Template
```markdown
# [Issue Title]

## Overview
Brief description of what this issue accomplishes.

## Requirements
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2
- Requirement 3

## Technical Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Estimation
- **Story Points**: X
- **Priority**: High/Medium/Low
- **Dependencies**: List any dependencies

*Part of [Module/Sprint]*
```

### Story Point Estimation
- **1 Point**: Simple task, < 2 hours
- **2 Points**: Small task, 2-4 hours
- **3 Points**: Medium task, 4-8 hours
- **5 Points**: Large task, 1-2 days
- **8 Points**: Complex task, 2-3 days
- **13 Points**: Epic task, 3-5 days
- **21 Points**: Major feature, 1+ weeks

## 🔄 Workflow Best Practices

### Sprint Planning
1. **Create Epic Issues**: One epic per major feature/module
2. **Break Down Tasks**: Create detailed subtasks for each epic
3. **Estimate Story Points**: Assign story points to all tasks
4. **Set Priorities**: Assign appropriate priority levels
5. **Identify Dependencies**: Link dependent issues

### Daily Workflow
1. **Start of Day**: Review assigned issues and update status
2. **During Work**: Update issue progress and add comments
3. **End of Day**: Update issue status and add progress notes

### Issue Status Transitions
- **Backlog → Todo**: Issue is planned and ready for work
- **Todo → In Progress**: Work has started on the issue
- **In Progress → In Review**: Code is complete, ready for review
- **In Review → Done**: Code is reviewed and approved
- **Done**: Issue is complete and deployed

### Branch Naming Convention
Linear automatically generates branch names using the format:
```
{username}/{issue-identifier}-{kebab-case-title}
```

Example: `jeremyshields/bus-2-crm-module-customer-database-implementation`

## 📊 Sprint Management

### Sprint Structure

## Automated Issue Title Checks

A GitHub Action is now in place to enforce the required issue title convention:

- **Required Format:** `[Module] Brief description of the feature/task`
- When a new issue is created or edited on GitHub, the action will:
  - Check the title for compliance.
  - If the title does not match, comment on the issue and add a `needs-title-fix` label.
  - When the title is corrected, the label will be removed automatically.
- This helps maintain a clean, searchable, and professional issue tracker.

> **Note:** This automation applies to all issues created or edited on GitHub. For Linear-native issues, please follow the same convention manually.

If you have questions about the correct format, refer to the examples above or ask the project maintainer.
