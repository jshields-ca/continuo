- Git

### Quick Start
1. **Clone and start**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd continuo
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   - **Web App**: http://localhost:3000
   - **API**: http://localhost:4000/graphql
   - **Database Admin**: http://localhost:8080
   - **Email Testing**: http://localhost:8025

3. **Test accounts**:
   - **Admin**: `admin@continuo-demo.com` / `TestPassword123!`
   - **Employee**: `employee@continuo-demo.com` / `Employee123!`

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Node.js** with Express
- **Apollo Server** for GraphQL
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Prisma** ORM
- **Redis** for caching (configured)
- **JWT** for authentication
- **bcrypt** for password hashing

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Apollo Client** for GraphQL
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **React Hooks** for state management

### DevOps
