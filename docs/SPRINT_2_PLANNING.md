## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Development

#### API Development
```javascript
// Example: Customer Resolver
const customerResolvers = {
  Query: {
    customers: async (_, { companyId, filters }, context) => {
      // Implementation for customer listing with filters
    },
    customer: async (_, { id }, context) => {
      // Implementation for single customer retrieval
    }
  },
  Mutation: {
    createCustomer: async (_, { input }, context) => {
      // Implementation for customer creation
    },
    updateCustomer: async (_, { id, input }, context) => {
      // Implementation for customer updates
    }
  }
};
```

#### Database Migrations
```sql
-- Example: Customer table migration
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  company_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES companies(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255),
  phone VARCHAR(50),
  address JSONB,
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_customers_company_id ON customers(company_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_email ON customers(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_customers_status ON customers(status);
```

### Frontend Development

#### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Example: Customer Management Component
interface Customer {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email?: string;
  phone?: string;
  status: CustomerStatus;
  contacts: Contact[];
}

const CustomerManagement: React.FC = () => {
  const [customers, setCustomers] = useState<Customer[]>([]);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
  const [filters, setFilters] = useState<CustomerFilters>({});

  // Implementation for customer management
};
```

#### State Management
```typescript
// Example: Customer Store
interface CustomerState {
  customers: Customer[];
  selectedCustomer: Customer | null;
  filters: CustomerFilters;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}

const customerSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'customers',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setCustomers: (state, action) => {
      state.customers = action.payload;
    },
    setSelectedCustomer: (state, action) => {
      state.selectedCustomer = action.payload;
    }
  }
});
