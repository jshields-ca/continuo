```

### **Documentation Update**
```
type/documentation + component/frontend + complexity/simple + impact/low
```

### **Security Enhancement**
```
type/enhancement + component/security + complexity/moderate + impact/high
```

## üìù **Label Usage Guidelines**

### **How Many Labels to Use**
- **Feature Labels**: 1-2 (main module(s) affected)
- **Type Labels**: 1 (work type)
- **Component Labels**: 1-2 (technical areas)
- **Environment Labels**: 1 (if environment-specific)
- **Sprint Labels**: 1 (current sprint)
- **Complexity Labels**: 1 (for estimation)
- **Impact Labels**: 1 (for prioritization)

### **When to Use Each Label Type**

#### **Feature Labels**
- Use when the issue affects a specific module or feature area
- Examples: CRM features, accounting functions, UI improvements

#### **Type Labels**
- Use to categorize the type of work being done
- Examples: new features, bug fixes, documentation updates

#### **Component Labels**
- Use to identify which technical components are involved
- Examples: backend API, frontend UI, database changes

#### **Environment Labels**
- Use when the issue is specific to a deployment environment
- Examples: production bugs, localhost testing issues

#### **Sprint Labels**
- Use to track which sprint the work belongs to
- Helps with sprint planning and retrospectives

#### **Complexity Labels**
- Use for effort estimation and planning
- Helps with sprint capacity planning

#### **Impact Labels**
- Use to indicate the impact on users or business
- Helps with prioritization decisions

## üîç **Filtering and Searching**

### **Common Filter Combinations**

#### **View All CRM Work**
```
feature/crm
```

#### **View All Bugs**
```
type/bug
```

#### **View High Impact Issues**
```
impact/high OR impact/critical
```

#### **View Sprint 2 Work**
```
sprint/2
```

#### **View Production Issues**
```
env/production
```

#### **View Complex Frontend Work**
```
component/frontend AND complexity/complex
```

## üìä **Reporting with Labels**

### **Sprint Metrics**
- Filter by `sprint/X` to see sprint-specific work
- Combine with `complexity/` labels for effort tracking
- Use `impact/` labels for value delivery analysis

### **Feature Development**
- Filter by `feature/X` to see module-specific progress
- Combine with `type/new-feature` for new development
- Use `type/enhancement` for improvements

### **Technical Debt**
- Filter by `type/refactor` or `type/performance`
- Combine with `impact/` labels for prioritization

### **Quality Assurance**
- Filter by `type/bug` to track bug resolution
- Combine with `type/testing` for testing work
- Use `env/` labels to track environment-specific issues

## üöÄ **Best Practices**

### **Label Selection**
1. **Start with Feature**: What module/area is affected?
2. **Add Type**: What type of work is this?
3. **Include Component**: What technical components are involved?
4. **Consider Environment**: Is this environment-specific?
5. **Add Sprint**: Which sprint does this belong to?
6. **Estimate Complexity**: How complex is this work?
7. **Assess Impact**: What's the user/business impact?

### **Label Maintenance**
- Review labels quarterly for relevance
- Remove unused labels to keep the system clean
- Add new labels as the project evolves
- Ensure consistent usage across the team

### **Label Training**
- Share this reference guide with new team members
- Use label combinations as examples in issue templates
- Review label usage in sprint retrospectives
